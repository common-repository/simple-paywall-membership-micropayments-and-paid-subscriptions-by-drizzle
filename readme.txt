Simple plugin for premium content creators and publishers to sell premium content and grow traffic in the most user-friendly way.  

== Description ==

Drizzle is a free, full-stack solution for premium content creators to start selling their best content directly to website visitors. Once installed, you can grow traffic, maximize conversions, and increase the number of paying users on your website.

This plugin will let you hide virtually any content in your posts (text, images, videos, links, and digital downloads). Your website visitors will be offered to pay for your content with just one click, or will be asked to provide non-monetary value -- such as sharing their information, sharing your content on social media, or disabling Adblock -- to view your content.


Hide content by including it in the following shortcodes: 
[drizzle] Your great content. [/drizzle]
